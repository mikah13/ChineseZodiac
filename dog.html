					<h3>The Dog's Personality:</h3>
					<p>
						Dogs are loyal and honest, amiable and kind, cautious and prudent. Due to having a strong sense of loyalty and sincerity, Dogs will do everything for the person who they think is most important. As Dogs are not good at communication, it is difficult for
						them to convey their thoughts to others. Therefore, Dogs tend to leave others with the impression that they have a stubborn personality. Born with a good nature, Dogs do not tend to be criminals or seek dishonest gains. They just need a quiet life
						and a good family and, therefore, forget the ugliness and evil on Earth. Dogs are always ready to help others and do not care about their own interests, but if they find themselves betrayed by cunning people they will feel shocked and hurt. When
						thrown into doubt, Dogs think the world is evil and complicated. Then they criticize sharply when giving comments on something, and infer all things are according to their pessimistic point of view.
					</p>
					<h3>The Best Careers for Dogs</h3>
					<p>
						Due to their loyal personality, Dogs tend to choose a career based on the principle of serving others. Dogs are seen as valuable employees as they put their heart and soul into their tasks. They are easygoing and kind, and are always ready to alleviate
						the workload of others, which makes them very popular in their work circle.

					</p>
					<p>
						Recommended careers for Dogs include a police officer, scientist, counselor, interior designer, professor, politician, priest, nurse, clerk, and judge
